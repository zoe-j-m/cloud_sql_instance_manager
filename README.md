# Cloud SQL Instance Manager

A command-line tool for managing GCP cloud_sql_proxy connections to a number of instances. 
It can automatically import your GCP project's Cloud SQL instances, assign ports to them, and start and stop the proxies.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install cloud_sql_instance_manager.

```bash
pip install cloud_sql_instance_manager
```

You will need to have [gcloud command line](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) installed and logged in with `gcloud auth login`

The manager will default to using the output of `which cloud_sql_proxy` to determine the location of the cloud_sql_proxy executable. You can override this with
```bash
cloud_sql config --path /FULL/PATH/TO/EXECUTABLE
```

## Usage

### Importing from gcloud

Ensure you are authenticated with gcloud command line.
```bash
cloud_sql import
```

The instance manager will import any (new) instances and automatically assign them ports.

If you want to specify a different project to your current default, then

```bash
cloud_sql import --project YOUR-PROJECT-NAME
```

### Nicknames
By default, instances are given a nickname of everything proceeding "-instance-" in the full name. For example - `test-application-instance-9956326571963535019` will get the nickname `test-application`
You can amend the nickname with 
```bash
cloud_sql update ORIGINAL-NICKNAME --nick NEW-NICKNAME
```

At any point, you can have more than one instance with the same nickname but different projects, and you can differentiate with `--project PROJECT-NAME`

### IAM
Set whether the manager will start the proxy with `--enable_iam_login` 
```bash
cloud_sql update NICKNAME --iam true
```

### Starting an instance

```bash
cloud_sql start NICK-NAME 
```

### Starting all default instances

```bash
cloud_sql start default 
```
Add `--project YOUR-PROJECT` to start only default instances for a particular project

### Stopping an instance

```bash
cloud_sql stop NICK-NAME 
```

### Stopping all running instances

```bash
cloud_sql stop all
```

### Listing instances
List all instances
```bash
cloud_sql list 
```
List all instances for a project
```bash
cloud_sql list --project YOUR-PROJECT
```

List all running instances
```bash
cloud_sql list-running
```
